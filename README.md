peg-custom
==========

###Custom written CLI frontend for the PHP Extension Generator.

#####Installation

PEG uses Composer for dependencies. To start, download or clone into peg-custom. Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run these commands to install composer:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

If all goes well, PEG should now be set up and ready to use! Just run php main.php to get started.
