peg-custom
==========

### Custom CLI frontend for the PHP Extension Generator.

This is a basic cli implementation used for testing and development of the
peg-src library. If your are planning to use peg please use
http://github.com/peg-org/peg-cli which is the official and fully featured
cli interface of the project.

##### Installation

PEG uses Composer for dependencies. To start, download or clone into peg-custom.
Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run these commands
to install composer:

```sh
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

If all goes well, PEG should now be set up and ready to use! Just run
php main.php to get started.
